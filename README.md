# Regularized-estimation-of-high-dimensional-quadratic-variation-based-on-high-frequency-data
This repository contains the Jupyter notebooks and code used in the master's thesis “Regularized estimation of high-dimensional quadratic variation based on high-frequency data” by Daniel Weggenmann.
The materials provided here allow reproduction of the analyses and figures reported in the manuscript.

## Contents
The code used in Chapter 6:
- Jupyter notebooks for the case of constant  drift and volatility (Section 7.2)
- Jupyter notebook for the case of a more sophisticated three-factor model (Section 7.3)
- (Optional) Jupyter notebook for an empirical example using real-world log-prices (Section 7.4)

## Reproducibility

All computational steps required to reproduce the results are documented within the notebooks.  
Necessary packages are listed there.
